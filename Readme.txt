Current version of the Kinect Approach is in the folder "\Code\Kinect Version". The final thing I have been working on was to find the boundary that the live-time data is within. In this version I
have already calculated the boundary that the user specifies using kinect. Also we need to change the Segmentation part of the algorithm which in this version is just a simple 'first angle checking' approach.
Current version of the Mouse Approach is in the folder "\Code\Mouse Version". This version needs to be changed; we need to align the vectors
and the angles separately.
TO investigate : We need to check the angles' score again to check the threshold.

There are some saved gesture information which are saved in the "Saved Gesture Data" these data can be loaded in the program.(Some of them might need some modifications realated to the version of the program)
The "\Code\Other Kinect Version" are the backups of the program in the different paces of time.
"Documentation\Document" consists of the report of the project which is not complete yet.
"\Documentation\vectorVSangle" and "\Documentation\vectorVSangleByeBye" are the datas showing that vectors are aligned well in performing gesture with different angles.
"\Documentation\Kinect Project (version 1)" is the powerpoint that I showed to professor Yin Kang Kang, of course it has been changed a lot after that
"\Documentation\Gesture Recognition version 2" is the powerpoint file that I presented at the last Seminar. It includes the abstract and introduction of the project and the final approaches I have chosen for the program
most of this powerpoint file has been created using the "Documentation\Document".
